This is the basic version of the Automated light that turns on, when the brigtness drops below a threshold level. 

This device works on Arduino and inputs the environmental stimulus using a photosensor. This photosensor(LDR) gives analog value to the Arduino board, to which the board compares the input with a reference value. IF the board finds that value is below the reference value, it will send a signal to switch on the attached LED.
